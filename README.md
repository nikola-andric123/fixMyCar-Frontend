# 🚗 fixMyCar - React Native Social App for Car Troubleshooting

**fixMyCar** is a mobile application built with **React Native** that connects car owners facing issues with their vehicles. The app serves as a social platform where users can share their car problems, view solutions posted by others, and receive real-time notifications when relevant issues are posted.

The mobile frontend communicates with a Node.js backend and uses **JWT authentication** and **Expo push notifications** to deliver a seamless user experience.

## 💡 Motivation & Inspiration

Car issues are a common frustration for many people, and often the best help comes from someone who's been through the same problem. The idea behind **fixMyCar** is to create a social network specifically for car owners — a place where users can:
- Post car issues they've encountered,
- Share how they solved them,
- Learn from others who experienced the same problems,
- Receive helpful notifications when new, related posts are made.

Whether it's a mysterious engine light or an odd sound from the wheels, **fixMyCar** aims to build a helpful community of shared experiences and solutions.
